# Sentoogle-Browser
Sentoogle is the future of browsers. You no longer need to enter the full URL or search for a specific website. Now you just enter the name of the website you need, and the AI ​​will search and open it automatically—no hassle and in just two clicks. The browser supports a huge number of features in addition to AI search.

# Detailed description
The browser features a user-friendly and beautiful design to ensure you're interacting with it without any issues or confusion about where to click or what to do. The browser is built using Sentient's AI products. The browser has four main AI-powered features: search, chat, summary of selected text, and explain (tell me more) of selected text. In the settings, you can select any of three AI engines for each of these four features: ROMA, Dobby 70B, and Dobby 8B.

# Installation and first launch
Move all the files to any convenient folder and install Node.js (nodejs.org). In the folder containing the files, open a cmd console, enter the first command: npm install, wait for all dependencies to be fully installed, then enter the second command: npm start. Your browser should open, and the console should display output of your browser interactions. You're all set!
